Do you want to stay focus on your work? Stop using facebook and other time-wasting websites.  
WFF is a simple and rude GUI to block/unblock websites.  

## How to use
1. Open WFF.exe
2. Insert the website to block (eg. www.facebook.com)
3. Click the button "Add filter" to add the website to the list
4. Click the button "Save" to confirm and block all the checked entries

Once the website is in the list, you can block or unblock it using the checkbox on the right of the entry.  
You can remove a website from the list by selecting it and then clicking the keyword "Canc" in your keyboard. 

## Export/Import the list
The list of websites is saved in `C:\ProgramData\WFF\wffstate.json`.  
Feel free to export or share it with your friends.

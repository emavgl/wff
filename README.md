Do you want to stay focused on your work, but can't get yourself to stop visiting Facebook and other time-wasting websites? You can use WFF to block those websites from loading altogether. WFF offers a simple GUI to block/unblock websites by modifying Windows's host file.

## How to use
1. Open WFF.exe
2. Insert the website to block (eg. `www.facebook.com` or `twitter.com`)
3. Click the button "Add filter" to add the website to the list
4. Click the button "Save" to confirm and block all the checked entries

Once the website is in the list, you can block or unblock it using the checkbox on the right of the entry.  
You can remove a website from the list by selecting it and then clicking the keyword "Canc" in your keyboard. 

## Export/Import the list
The list of websites is saved in `C:\ProgramData\WFF\wffstate.json`.  
Feel free to export or share it with your friends.
